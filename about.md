Welcome to my blog, I started coding when I was 12 on a Commodore 64. 
I've never been blogging, but I've seen so many interesting blogs lately, that I wanted to start sharing my personal thoughts about code and discoveries with the community.

The name BeastCode is a play on word from BeastMode, and yes I live in Seattle.

Happy coding! /Mike
